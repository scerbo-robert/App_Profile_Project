# First_Data_Science_Project
This is my first data science project, I collect, clean and analyze data from two sets.
In this project I use two data sets, one held information on apps in the App Store, the other held similar information on apps in the Google Play market.
I clean the data from both data sets, this is follow by some analysis and I finally make an app profile recommendation based on the findings in my analysis.
